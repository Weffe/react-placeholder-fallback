**v2.1.1** brings in a new method that I am sure will be helpful for advanced configuration. 


## Features include

- Ability to generate custom configurable `PlaceholderFallback` components

## Any big updates?

The jump from `v1` to `v2` saw an internal move from `parcel` to `webpack` to fix a build issue.
Not only that, IE11 is now properly supported due to the usage of `Array.includes` in `v1`. Lastly,
the prebuilt placeholders have now been grouped under one exported namespace.
